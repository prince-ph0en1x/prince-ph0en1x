### Hi there 👋

I work on topics spanning quantum computation, algorithmic information, computer engineering, explainable artificial intelligence, and philosophy.

I am a senior researcher at [Fujitsu Research India Private Limited](https://www.fujitsu.com/in/about/local/corporate/subsidiaries/fri-research-vision.html) in the Quantum Technology Division in Bengaluru, India.

Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher in the [Quantum Machine Learning group](https://qutech.nl/lab/feld-group/) at [QuTech](https://qutech.nl/person/aritra-sarkar/). I did my doctoral research in the [Quantum Computer Architecture lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/quantum-computer-engineering/quantum-computer-architecture-lab/staff/aritra-sarkar/) on [**Applications of Quantum Computation and Algorithmic Information for Causal Modeling in Genomics and Reinforcement Learning**](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:0952c9e9-115c-4672-9381-2b302d1b9576). I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering, (now called [MSc Computer & Embedded Systems Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/msc-computer-embedded-systems-engineering)) with my thesis on [Quantum Algorithms for Pattern Matching on Genomic Sequences](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A4257310d-6d8b-4f5a-9fda-00cf8e081f0e). Before shifting to the Netherlands, I was a scientist at the Indian Space Research Organisation, and programmed satellites like Astrosat, Chandrayaan-2, Cartosat, Resourcesat, etc.

Most of my current GitHub activities are hosted under the [Quantum Intelligence Alliance](https://github.com/Advanced-Research-Centre) and [FRIPL Quantum](https://github.com/FRIPL-Quantum) organizations. Past projects and collaborations can be accessed at [Quantum Machine Learning](https://github.com/QML-Group) and [Quantum Computer Architecture Lab](https://github.com/QE-Lab).
