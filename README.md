### Hi there 👋

I am a post-doctoral researcher at [QuTech](https://qutech.nl/person/aritra-sarkar/) in the Quantum Machine Learning group. I work on topics spanning general intelligence, quantum computation, algorithmic information, computer engineering and philosophy.

I did my doctoral research in the [QCA lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/quantum-computer-engineering/quantum-computer-architecture-lab/staff/aritra-sarkar/) on [**Applications of Quantum Computation and Algorithmic Information for Causal Modeling in Genomics and Reinforcement Learning**](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:0952c9e9-115c-4672-9381-2b302d1b9576). Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in [Computer Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/computer-engineering/msc-computer-engineering/) with my thesis on [Quantum Algorithms for Pattern Matching on Genomic Sequences](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A4257310d-6d8b-4f5a-9fda-00cf8e081f0e). Before shifting to the Netherlands, I was a scientist at the Indian Space Research Organisation, and programmed satellites like Astrosat, Chandrayaan-2, Cartosat, Resourcesat, etc.
